NextHikes Real Estate Pricing Analysis

This repository presents a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on real estate pricing. Leveraging Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn), we uncover key variables influencing house prices.

Project Overview
- Loaded and cleaned the Data
- Conducted univariate and multivariate analyses
- Engineered features (price per square foot, property age)
- Analyzed market trends, customer preferences, and amenities

Key Findings
- Identified significant correlations between sales price, living area, lot-to-square-foot ratio, and seasonal fluctuations.

Tools and Techniques
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Data visualization (heatmaps, scatter plots)
- Statistical analysis (correlation, regression)
